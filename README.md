# ðŸŸ¦ TypeScript: 7 Languages in 7 Weeks

This repository contains my TypeScript solutions and notes from the [7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks](#) challenge.

## ðŸ“š Week 1: Core Concepts

### âœ… Variables
- Learned how to use `let` and `const`
- Practiced type annotations: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- Used template literals with `${}` inside backticks
- Built mini shopping cart example
- Bonus: Wrote a program to calculate years until user reaches target age

**Example:**
```ts
let name: string = "Monica";
let age: number = 16;
let targetAge: number = 65;
console.log(`${name} will reach ${targetAge} in ${targetAge - age} years.`);
